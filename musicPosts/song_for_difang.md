It still blows my mind that Kenny and his band recorded this great record on 9/11 after the attacks when the whole nation was in a state of panic. They were laying doing beautiful sounds that they knew the rest of us would still need. I saw this band in Boston with Chris Dave on drums, and hadn't heard of Chris prior to that show. Kenny is always amazing no matter the night, but it was especially fun to see him with someone with that much pocket on the drums. I of course don't do it justice here, but I'm having fun playing either way.
