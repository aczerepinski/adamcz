A little solo jam during quarantine. Dolphin Dance is from Herbie Hancock's amazing 1965 album, Maiden Voyage.

This was my first time using DaVinci Resolve, and my first time in many years using Logic Pro. Also my first time in many years playing the trumpet or flugelhorn! Nice to get back to it after too much time away.

Gear used:
- Fender fretless jazz bass (MIM), recorded through Aguilar Tonehammer 500 amp
- Yamaha YFH731 Flugelhorn
- Kawai K3 piano

Each instrument was recorded live in one take. I also did a rough recording before filming so that I'd have something to play along with.
