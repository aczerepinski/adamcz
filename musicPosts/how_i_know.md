Roy Hargrove recorded this song with his RH Factor band on "Hard Groove," released in 2003. One of the reasons I keep coming back to this album is that in addition to it featuring one of my all time favorite trumpet players (Roy), it also features one of my all time favorite bass players (Pino Palladino).

Roy and Pino wrote this song along with vocalist Shelby Johnson and guitarist Chalmers "Spanky" Alford.

Gear used:

- Fender fretless jazz bass (MIM), recorded through an Aguilar Tonehammer 500 amp

- Kawai K3 piano

- Monette 2000LT trumpet with a B2 mouthpiece

- Yamaha YFH731 flugelhorn with a Monette FLG2 mouthpiece

- Gretsch Catalina Club drums and Zildjian K cymbals

- Shure KSM141 microphones through a Focusrite Scarlett 4i4 interface
