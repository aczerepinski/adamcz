This song from OK Computer is a perfect example of why Radiohead is such a favorite among jazz musicians. Paranoid Android's harmonies are super creative, the melodies sit well on any instrument, and it even offers a less common time signature to jam out on.

Gear used:

- Fender fretless jazz bass (MIM), recorded through an Aguilar Tonehammer 500 amp

- Monette 2000LT trumpet with a B2 mouthpiece
