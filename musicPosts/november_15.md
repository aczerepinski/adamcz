Kenny Garrett's Songbook is one of my favorite albums of the 1990s. His playing is (as always) intense, yet melodic. The tunes are all very singable but not in a watered down way. Kenny Kirkland and Jeff Tain Watts - with Nat Reeves on this record or Eric Revis on Branford Marsalis's records - is one of the best rhythm sections of all time. I recorded this on 11/13/21 so I could edit it on the 14th and get it published on the correct date.

Gear used:

- Estonia 190 piano

- Fodera Monarch P bass, recorded through an Aguilar Tonehammer 500 amp
