Lionel Loueke is one of my absolute favorite musicians on any instrument. I think I first heard this song on Gretchen Parlato's first album, and it's been recorded by quite a few musicians since. It's a super versatile tune and sounds good slow or fast, and in 5/4 or 6/4 (and probably more!).

Gear used:

- Estonia 190 piano

- Fodera Monarch P bass, recorded through an Aguilar Tonehammer 500 amp

- Monette 2000 LT trumpet with a B2 mouthpiece

- Microphones: Shure KSM141 (x2), AEA R84A
