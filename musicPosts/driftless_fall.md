The "driftless" region of southern Wisconsin is full of beautiful rolling hills, farms, marshes, and forests. I'm lucky to be able to run and bike on sparsely traveled roads with beautiful scenery.


All of the footage is actually from fall of 2023. I meant to write and record a song inspired by the views last year, but didn't get around to it until this year.
