Chick Corea has always been one of my favorite piano players, and he's also an amazing composer. This song is from his first album - recorded in his 20's, and already he was writing tunes that will be played forever.

Gear used:

- Fodera Monarch P bass, recorded through an Aguilar Tonehammer 500 amp

- Estonia 190 Piano

- Shure KSM141 microphones through a Focusrite Scarlett 4i4 interface

Thanks for listening!

-Adam
