The first time I saw Bruno and Anderson's original video of this tune, I knew I wanted to record it myself. In addition to being a great jam, I love the humor in their video.

Gear used:

- Fodera Monarch P bass, recorded through an Aguilar Tonehammer 500 amp

- Kawai K3 piano

- Monette 2000LT trumpet with a B4LD mouthpiece

- Yamaha YFH731 flugelhorn with a Monette FLG2 mouthpiece

- Gretsch Catalina Club drums and Zildjian K cymbals

- Shure KSM141 microphones through a Focusrite Scarlett 4i4 interface
