This is a beautiful song that Eric Clapton recorded on the 1992 live album Unplugged, and again on the 1998 album Pilgrim.

Gear used:
- Fender fretless jazz bass (MIM), recorded through an Aguilar Tonehammer 500 amp
- Kawai K3 piano
- Monette 2000LT trumpet with a B2 mouthpiece
- LP egg shaker

Each instrument was recorded live in one take. I also did a rough recording before filming so that I'd have something to play along with.

Thanks for listening!

-Adam
