Duke Ellington & Billy Strayhorn wrote the suite "Such Sweet Thunder" for the 1957 Stratford Shakespearean festival in Ontario. This song - which I recorded a few days before Valentine's Day - is a nod to Romeo and Juliet.

Gear used:

- Estonia 190 piano

- Fodera Monarch P bass, recorded through an Aguilar Tonehammer 500 amp

- Monette 2000 LT trumpet with a B2 mouthpiece

- Microphones: Shure KSM141 (x2), AEA R84A
