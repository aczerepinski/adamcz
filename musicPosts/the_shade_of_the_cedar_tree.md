Christian McBride was at the center of the 1990's "young lions" jazz movement. His first album "Gettin' To It" - recorded at age 22 and featuring Joshua Redman and Roy Hargrove - embodies the music I grew up with as a 90's kid. He recorded this song at least two more times on "The Good Feeling" and "Live at the Village Vanguard."

It was a blast to record this song with two of Madison's best jazz musicians, who also happen to be young enough to be considered young lions themselves. It felt fitting to record one of McBride's tunes with these guys because the three of us were all in the audience when Christian headlined the Madison Jazz Festival in June.
