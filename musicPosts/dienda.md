One of my favorite songs by Kenny Kirkland. This is from Branford Marsalis's 1986 record, Royal Garden Blues. Sting - who had toured with Kenny in his band - later wrote lyrics to it and recorded it on All This Time. Watch to the end to see my cat!

Gear used:

- Fender fretless jazz bass (MIM), recorded through Aguilar Tonehammer 500 amp

- Kawai K3 piano

Each instrument was recorded live in one take. I also did a rough recording before filming so that I'd have something to play along with.

Thanks for listening!

-Adam
