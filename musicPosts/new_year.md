Happy New Year!  This song is from Pat's album "Unity" which turns 10 years old this year. I wanted to start the year off by recording something on my new Prophet-6 synth. Unfortunately, it's barely audible on this track. Next time!

Gear used:

- Vintage Vibe 73 Deluxe electric piano

- Prophet-6 analog synth

- Fodera Monarch P bass, recorded through an Aguilar Tonehammer 500 amp

- Gretsch Catalina Club drums and Zildjian K Sweet cymbals

- Microphones: Shure KSM141 (x2), Electro-Voice RE20, Shure SM57
