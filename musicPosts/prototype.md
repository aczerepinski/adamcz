Andre Benjamin (aka Andre 3000) wrote this beautiful song for OutKast's Album of the Year winning record, Speakerboxxx/The Love Below.

Gear used:
- Fender fretless jazz bass (MIM), recorded through an Aguilar Tonehammer 500 amp
- Kawai K3 piano
- Monette 2000LT trumpet with a B2 mouthpiece
- Yamaha YFH731 flugelhorn with a Monette FLG2 mouthpiece

Each instrument was recorded live in one take. I also did a rough recording before filming so that I'd have something to play along with.

Thanks for listening!

-Adam
