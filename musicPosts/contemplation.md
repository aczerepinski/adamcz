McCoy Tyner's 1967 record "The Real McCoy" is a classic that I've been listening to for decades. It's so full of intensity and passion, but it's also melodic and soulful.

This recording is my first chance to explore my new fretless bass, which I received a few days prior. I have a lot of practice ahead of me on the instrument, but it's a joy to play!

Gear used:

- Estonia 190 piano

- Fodera Monarch Fretless bass, recorded through an Aguilar Tonehammer 500 amp

- Gretsch Catalina Club drums and Zildjian K Sweet cymbals

- Monette 2000LT trumpet with a B2 mouthpiece

- Microphones: Shure KSM141 (x2), Electro-Voice RE20, AEA R84A
