I've been listening to Avishai's record Gently Disturbed for years! It's cold as heck in Wisconsin so I'm happy to spend a Saturday recording a great tune and editing it on my laptop by the fireplace.

Gear used:
- Fodera Monarch P bass, recorded through an Aguilar Tonehammer 500 amp

- Estonia 190 Piano, recorded with Shure KSM141 microphones
